This app allows you to, when using Spotify, see what events are coming up for the artist you are listening to, or 
search for any artist without logging into Spotify to find events that will be held for them.
The list will contain the event name, location, pricing information, date, and a link to Ticketmaster for further information on the event should the options be available.
Technologies included in this were HTML/CSS/JavaScript/jQuery.
